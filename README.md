# ✅ Tasky Project

**Tasky** is a sleek and lightweight to-do app template built with modern technologies like **Vue 3**, **Composition API**, **Pinia**, **Vue Router**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS** and **Supabase**. It's designed to be a perfect starting point for building personal task managers or productivity tools.

The app provides a clean and intuitive interface for managing tasks efficiently. Users can create, edit, mark as completed and delete their tasks — all changes are reflected in real time through seamless backend integration with **Supabase**. The core **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) are fully implemented within a responsive, user-friendly dashboard, ensuring complete control over task lifecycle.
